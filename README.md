## Problem Definition

The airline industry faces significant challenges in traditional booking processes, including long wait times, manual paperwork, and high potential for errors. These inefficiencies can lead to a poor passenger experience, decreased customer satisfaction, and lost revenue opportunities. This project aims to develop an Airline Reservation System (ARS) that addresses these issues by providing an efficient, user-friendly platform for managing flight bookings and enhancing the overall passenger experience.

## Problem Analysis

### Key Issues:
1. **Inefficiency**: Traditional booking methods are time-consuming and often result in long queues.
2. **Errors**: Manual management of customer information and reservations can lead to mistakes.
3. **Customer Experience**: A lack of real-time updates and personalized services can diminish passenger satisfaction.
4. **Data Management**: There is a need for a centralized system to manage flight information, customer data, and reservations.

### Objectives:
- Streamline the booking process to reduce wait times and errors.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for customers to easily navigate the system.
